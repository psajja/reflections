When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When you want to share your code.
  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You would have control over what is in your local repo. It this occurs automatically, if there are other colaborators for the git repo, then you would not have control over the contents in your local repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Forks : If you want to make a clone of someoneelse project on github(u r account)
Clones : If you want to make a copy of a project on local machine
Branch : In a repo, if you want to make changes or experimental changes without effecting the master branch. 


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
