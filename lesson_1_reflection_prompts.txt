How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros : You get to pick when to commit. You commit at logical points
	Cons : You have to remember to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    For code, it makes sense to save all versions of the dependencies. 
    For just text, which doesn't have dependencies to just save that one file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can be used to look at all the previous version of the files
	git diff can be used to compare 2 commits. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Since you know that you can checkout previous versions in the future verions. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
